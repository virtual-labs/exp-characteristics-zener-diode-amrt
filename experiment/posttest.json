      "question": "Which instrument is used to measure the current through the Zener diode in the experimental setup?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Voltmeter",
        "b": "Ammeter",
        "c": "Milliammeter",
        "d": "Ohmmeter"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Voltmeter measures potential difference.",
        "b": "Partially correct. But milliammeter is more suitable for low currents.",
        "c": "Correct. It accurately measures small currents in this setup.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Ohmmeter measures resistance."

      "question": "In the reverse bias configuration, the cathode of the Zener diode is connected to:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The negative terminal of the DC supply",
        "b": "Ground",
        "c": "The positive terminal of the DC supply",
        "d": "A capacitor"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. That would be forward bias.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Grounding isn't a standard connection in this setup.",
        "c": "Correct. This configuration ensures reverse bias.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Capacitors are not relevant here."

      "question": "What is the typical range of Zener breakdown voltages available commercially?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "0.1 V to 1 V",
        "b": "2 V to 200 V",
        "c": "220 V to 440 V",
        "d": "500 V to 1000 V"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Most Zener diodes start from 2V and above.",
        "b": "Correct. This is the standard commercial range.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This range is too high for standard Zeners.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Zener diodes above 200V are rare."

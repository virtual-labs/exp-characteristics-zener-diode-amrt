      "question": "What is the primary purpose of using a Zener diode in reverse bias in this experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To block all current flow",
        "b": "To observe the avalanche effect",
        "c": "To study the breakdown behavior and determine Zener voltage",
        "d": "To act as a regular diode"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Zener diodes allow current in reverse once breakdown voltage is reached.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Avalanche effect is a different breakdown mechanism.",
        "c": "Correct. This is the key purpose of the experiment.",
        "d": "Incorrect. That applies to forward bias."

      "question": "In the forward bias region, a Zener diode behaves like:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "An open circuit",
        "b": "A variable resistor",
        "c": "A normal p-n junction diode",
        "d": "A short circuit with zero voltage"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. In forward bias, current flows easily.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Resistance does not vary linearly.",
        "c": "Correct. It acts like a regular diode.",
        "d": "Incorrect. There's a forward voltage drop (~0.7V for silicon)."

      "question": "What happens to the voltage across a Zener diode once the reverse breakdown voltage is reached?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It increases rapidly",
        "b": "It drops to zero",
        "c": "It remains nearly constant",
        "d": "It oscillates"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The voltage stabilizes, not increases.",
        "b": "Incorrect. It stabilizes around Zener voltage, not zero.",
        "c": "Correct. The voltage stays nearly constant in breakdown.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Zener diodes do not oscillate in reverse bias."
